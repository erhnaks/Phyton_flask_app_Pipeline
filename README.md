When app launch the user is shown the homepage:

The application **Navbar** provides links to the endusers to add a chef, view created chef's and their pizza's.  T create a chef, the user simply clicks on the link and the app takes them to the **create** a chef page:

The user is then redirected to a page where they can the presented with their created chef details.

User then be able to **create** a pizza with their desired seletions of pizza crust, base, and toppings at createapizza page;

User is then taken to homepage where they can see their custom made pizza on **read** page(s):

## The Future Improvements
There are multiple improvements I would like to implement in the future and they are;
* Allow users to register with the app and write comments or add their own desired toppings.
* Allow users to contact eachother to created mastered joint pizza's.
* Allow chef's to sell their Pizza's to users.
* Users can customize their profile page and add other chef's or users as a friends, change their profile page colour palette of the website, upload their final photo of their custom pizza's, and send or receive private messages.
* Allowing users to add other ingredients.
* Add a search bar for easier and quicker nagivation.
